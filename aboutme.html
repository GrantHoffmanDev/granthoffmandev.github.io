									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>A web developer who has a love for technology and travel.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/aboutme.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I'm Grant Hoffman, a web developer that loves technology, but equally loves traveling and the outdoors.</p>
								<p>I went to school for Computer Information Systems with a focus on web development.  I have an associates in Computer Information Systems and Information Technology.  I also have many certifications I have received throughout the years.  From web development certificates, to windows server ones.  I strive to continue to learn and grow as a developer and a person, continuing this journey we call life, with an ever expanding knowledge base.</p>
								<p>My career in the computer science field took off when I began as an IT Specialist at U.S. Bank, working there for a few years while working on schooling and certifications.  I then took my schooling and knowledge, and brought that over to EvenVision.  Working closely with a small team of developers, creating a sense of learning and family while working there.</p>
								<p>I started at EvenVision being a junior front-end developer, while handling customer facing questions and problems.  Working closely with our backend developer and clients to solve problems, or make their visions real on their site.  As time passed, I became the main front-end developer, while knowing some backend.  I began creating websites from start to finish and maintaining them as time went on.  I then later took on the role as the main backend developer, working closely with my higher ups and others to provide knowledge and ask important questions to continue to move us forward.  I also then took on the role of working closely with our clients, providing Search Engine Optimization for their sites and the analytics of their site.  Providing important information to the client to continue to expand their businesses.</p>
								<p>I have learned a plethora over these few short years, from becoming proficient in many languages, to learning how to handle important client communication that can make or break the future of their's and our business.</p>
								<p>In my personal life, I enjoy my technology and nature.  I have lived in Oregon my entire life and love the nature around me; it continues amazing views and a sense of peace from my crazy life.  I have traveled to Europe on two separate occasions, once backpacking on my own.  While backpacking Europe, I traveled from Amsterdam to Denmark by bus and train and was a life changing experience and would give anything to go back and do it again.</p>
								<p>I strive to continue my career while continuing to adventure.  Thankfully, with technology and my passion, I can continue to do both at the same time!</p>
